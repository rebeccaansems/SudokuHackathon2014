===================
Magic - Sudoku Solver allows users to enter in a Sudoku puzzle, easy (2x2) or hard (3x3), and then either solve the full puzzle outright or enter in other numbers into remaining squares, then check to see if they're right. This allows the user to both find the full solution to the puzzle as well as see if they are correct with their own guesses (without seeing if they're correct about all their guesses, or solving the puzzle entirely). 

Magic solves the puzzles by creating a 2D array with the user inputted data. Magic then checks for row, column, and box conflicts, returning a true boolean if there is a conflict. Magic continues to run through different combinations of numbers (for the spots that the user did not input a number) until a set of numbers is found which does not return true for any of the conflict checks. Next Magic checks to see if there are any more sets of numbers that could result in a solution, if there is another set of numbers that could also be a solution then Magic warns the user that the solution shown may not be the only solution possible.
